Whenever you're adding a new string to the codebase, make sure to add it to a translation file in `locales/en`.

If you're using a translation key in the codebase, that's how to use it:

```tsx
import { useTranslations } from "next-intl";

const t = useTranslations();

t("common.delete"); // maps to locales/en/common.json -> "delete"
```
